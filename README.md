# Drowsiness Detection System  

##  Overview  
The **Drowsiness Detection System** is a **computer vision-based** project that helps detect when a person is feeling drowsy while driving. It captures real-time video from a webcam, analyzes eye aspect ratio (EAR) using **Mediapipe Face Mesh**, and alerts the user if drowsiness is detected.  

## Features  
-  Real-time face & eye detection
-  Drowsiness detection using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)  
-  Alarm sound when drowsiness is detected 
-  Works on different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
-  Uses OpenCV, Mediapipe, and NumPy for fast processing  

##  Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python 
- **Libraries Used:** OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy  
- **Hardware:** Webcam for real-time detection
